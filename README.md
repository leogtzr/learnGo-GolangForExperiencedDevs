Code Snippets for a Go course: Golang for Experienced Devs

## Six Main Points about Go
### 1 - Statically Typed Language
```Go
var myVariable string
// or
var myVariable = "myString"
```

### 2 - Strongly Typed Language
In Go, we cannot do something like this:
```Go
a = 1
b = "two"
c = a + b
```

### 3 - Go is compiled
### 4 - Fast Compile Time
### 5 - Built In Concurrency
Goroutines are great.

### 6 - Simplicity
